## Generating playlists for a fictional music streaming service
### Jan Filipecki, Jakub Niezabitowski

## Project description

The project is a part of the course "Machnie Learning Engineering" at Warsaw Univeristy of Technology. The goal of the project is to create a playlist generator for a fictional music streaming service. The generator is based on the data from the service's database, which contains information about the users, their listening history, and the songs available in the service. The generator is supposed to create playlists that would appeal to a large number of users, and it is not specified whether the playlists should be personalized or not. The project is divided into three main parts: data preprocessing, playlist generation, and evaluation of the generated playlists.
